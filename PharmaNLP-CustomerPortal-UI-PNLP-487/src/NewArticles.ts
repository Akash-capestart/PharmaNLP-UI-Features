        "Phase 2 trial of the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod plus gemcitabine / nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreas cancer.",
      publicationYear: "2018",
      abstractData:
        "Background: The indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway is a key counter-regulatory mechanism that is exploited by tumors to prevent and evade anti-tumor immunity. Inhibitors of the IDO pathway, such as indoximod, are an increasingly validated class of potential cancer therapeutics. The combination of gemcitabine (G) and nab-paclitaxel (N) is a current SOC for metastatic pancreas cancer (MPC). Pre-clinical models have demonstrated synergy between indoximod and chemotherapy. Methods: Single arm study with indoximod (1200mg BID continuous) plus G / N (1000mg/m2 / 125mg/m2 q week x3 per 4-week cycle). Patients had treatment naïve MPC or 1st line therapy after previous resection and adjuvant therapy. Treatment continued until disease progression or toxicity. Primary endpoint was an improvement in median overall survival (mOS) from a historical 8.5 months for G / N to 12.1 months (hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) by site review RECIST 1.1. An expansion cohort enrolled patients undergoing pre and on-treatment (end Cycle 2) tumor biopsies. Results: A total of 135 patients initiated treatment in Phase 2 including 36 in the biopsy group. 104 were efficacy evaluable (EE) per the pre-specified definition of completing one cycle of therapy with one on-treatment imaging study. The ORR in the EE was 46.2% (48/104) with 1% CR (1/104) and 45.2% PR (47/104). The mOS in the EE was 10.9 months. Combination was generally well tolerated with fatigue, nausea, and anemia being the most commonly observed adverse events. Immunologic data by immunohistochemistry from biopsy samples (n = 11) indicate responders have increased intra-tumoral CD8 density after 2 cycles of therapy compared to non-responders (p = 0.030). Conclusions: EE patients had a mOS of 10.9 months and ORR of 46.2%; responding patients had an increased intra-tumoral CD8 density. The study did not meet the pre-specified primary goal of a 30% reduction in HR. However, the combination demonstrated activity with a promising ORR and immunologic correlation with response. These data support the continued development of combination indoximod immuno-chemotherapy for MPC. Clinical trial information: NCT02077881.",

            "Purpose: NCIC Clinical Trials Group PA.3 was a randomized control trial that demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) in patients receiving erlotinib in addition to Gemcitabine for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Prior to therapy, patients had plasma samples drawn for future study. We sought to identify biomarkers within these samples.\nExperimental design: Using the proximity ligation assay (PLA), a probe panel was built from commercially available antibodies for 35 key proteins selected from a global genetic analysis of pancreatic cancers, and used to quantify protein levels in 20 uL of patient plasma. To determine if any of these proteins levels independently associated with OS, univariate and mulitbaraible Cox models were used. In addition, we examined the associations between biomarker expression and disease stage at diagnosis using Fisher's exact test. The correlation between Erlotinib sensitivity and each biomarkers was assessed using a test of interaction between treatment and biomarker.\nResults and conclusion: Of the 569 eligible patients, 480 had samples available for study. Samples were randomly allocated into training (251) and validation sets (229). Among all patients, elevated levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha), and interleukin-6 were independently associated with lower OS, while IL-8, CEA, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and mucin-1 were associated with metastatic disease. Patients with elevated levels of receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2) expression had improved OS when treated with erlotinib compared to placebo. In conclusion, PLA is a powerful tool for identifying biomarkers from archived, small volume serum samples. These data may be useful to stratify patient outcomes regardless of therapeutic intervention.",

          "Background: The indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway is a key counter-regulatory mechanism that is exploited by tumors to prevent and evade anti-tumor immunity. Inhibitors of the IDO pathway, such as indoximod, are an increasingly validated class of potential cancer therapeutics. The combination of gemcitabine (G) and nab-paclitaxel (N) is a current SOC for metastatic pancreas cancer (MPC). Pre-clinical models have demonstrated synergy between indoximod and chemotherapy. Methods: Single arm study with indoximod (1200mg BID continuous) plus G / N (1000mg/m2 / 125mg/m2 q week x3 per 4-week cycle). Patients had treatment naïve MPC or 1st line therapy after previous resection and adjuvant therapy. Treatment continued until disease progression or toxicity. Primary endpoint was an improvement in median overall survival (mOS) from a historical 8.5 months for G / N to 12.1 months (hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) by site review RECIST 1.1. An expansion cohort enrolled patients undergoing pre and on-treatment (end Cycle 2) tumor biopsies. Results: A total of 135 patients initiated treatment in Phase 2 including 36 in the biopsy group. 104 were efficacy evaluable (EE) per the pre-specified definition of completing one cycle of therapy with one on-treatment imaging study. The ORR in the EE was 46.2% (48/104) with 1% CR (1/104) and 45.2% PR (47/104). The mOS in the EE was 10.9 months. Combination was generally well tolerated with fatigue, nausea, and anemia being the most commonly observed adverse events. Immunologic data by immunohistochemistry from biopsy samples (n = 11) indicate responders have increased intra-tumoral CD8 density after 2 cycles of therapy compared to non-responders (p = 0.030). Conclusions: EE patients had a mOS of 10.9 months and ORR of 46.2%; responding patients had an increased intra-tumoral CD8 density. The study did not meet the pre-specified primary goal of a 30% reduction in HR. However, the combination demonstrated activity with a promising ORR and immunologic correlation with response. These data support the continued development of combination indoximod immuno-chemotherapy for MPC. Clinical trial information: NCT02077881.",

            abstractData:
              "Purpose: NCIC Clinical Trials Group PA.3 was a randomized control trial that demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) in patients receiving erlotinib in addition to Gemcitabine for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Prior to therapy, patients had plasma samples drawn for future study. We sought to identify biomarkers within these samples.\nExperimental design: Using the proximity ligation assay (PLA), a probe panel was built from commercially available antibodies for 35 key proteins selected from a global genetic analysis of pancreatic cancers, and used to quantify protein levels in 20 uL of patient plasma. To determine if any of these proteins levels independently associated with OS, univariate and mulitbaraible Cox models were used. In addition, we examined the associations between biomarker expression and disease stage at diagnosis using Fisher's exact test. The correlation between Erlotinib sensitivity and each biomarkers was assessed using a test of interaction between treatment and biomarker.\nResults and conclusion: Of the 569 eligible patients, 480 had samples available for study. Samples were randomly allocated into training (251) and validation sets (229). Among all patients, elevated levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha), and interleukin-6 were independently associated with lower OS, while IL-8, CEA, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and mucin-1 were associated with metastatic disease. Patients with elevated levels of receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2) expression had improved OS when treated with erlotinib compared to placebo. In conclusion, PLA is a powerful tool for identifying biomarkers from archived, small volume serum samples. These data may be useful to stratify patient outcomes regardless of therapeutic intervention.",

            abstractData:
              "Purpose: NCIC Clinical Trials Group PA.3 was a randomized control trial that demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) in patients receiving erlotinib in addition to Gemcitabine for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Prior to therapy, patients had plasma samples drawn for future study. We sought to identify biomarkers within these samples.\nExperimental design: Using the proximity ligation assay (PLA), a probe panel was built from commercially available antibodies for 35 key proteins selected from a global genetic analysis of pancreatic cancers, and used to quantify protein levels in 20 uL of patient plasma. To determine if any of these proteins levels independently associated with OS, univariate and mulitbaraible Cox models were used. In addition, we examined the associations between biomarker expression and disease stage at diagnosis using Fisher's exact test. The correlation between Erlotinib sensitivity and each biomarkers was assessed using a test of interaction between treatment and biomarker.\nResults and conclusion: Of the 569 eligible patients, 480 had samples available for study. Samples were randomly allocated into training (251) and validation sets (229). Among all patients, elevated levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha), and interleukin-6 were independently associated with lower OS, while IL-8, CEA, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and mucin-1 were associated with metastatic disease. Patients with elevated levels of receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2) expression had improved OS when treated with erlotinib compared to placebo. In conclusion, PLA is a powerful tool for identifying biomarkers from archived, small volume serum samples. These data may be useful to stratify patient outcomes regardless of therapeutic intervention.",

        publicationYear: "2018",
        abstractData:
          "Background: The indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway is a key counter-regulatory mechanism that is exploited by tumors to prevent and evade anti-tumor immunity. Inhibitors of the IDO pathway, such as indoximod, are an increasingly validated class of potential cancer therapeutics. The combination of gemcitabine (G) and nab-paclitaxel (N) is a current SOC for metastatic pancreas cancer (MPC). Pre-clinical models have demonstrated synergy between indoximod and chemotherapy. Methods: Single arm study with indoximod (1200mg BID continuous) plus G / N (1000mg/m2 / 125mg/m2 q week x3 per 4-week cycle). Patients had treatment naïve MPC or 1st line therapy after previous resection and adjuvant therapy. Treatment continued until disease progression or toxicity. Primary endpoint was an improvement in median overall survival (mOS) from a historical 8.5 months for G / N to 12.1 months (hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) by site review RECIST 1.1. An expansion cohort enrolled patients undergoing pre and on-treatment (end Cycle 2) tumor biopsies. Results: A total of 135 patients initiated treatment in Phase 2 including 36 in the biopsy group. 104 were efficacy evaluable (EE) per the pre-specified definition of completing one cycle of therapy with one on-treatment imaging study. The ORR in the EE was 46.2% (48/104) with 1% CR (1/104) and 45.2% PR (47/104). The mOS in the EE was 10.9 months. Combination was generally well tolerated with fatigue, nausea, and anemia being the most commonly observed adverse events. Immunologic data by immunohistochemistry from biopsy samples (n = 11) indicate responders have increased intra-tumoral CD8 density after 2 cycles of therapy compared to non-responders (p = 0.030). Conclusions: EE patients had a mOS of 10.9 months and ORR of 46.2%; responding patients had an increased intra-tumoral CD8 density. The study did not meet the pre-specified primary goal of a 30% reduction in HR. However, the combination demonstrated activity with a promising ORR and immunologic correlation with response. These data support the continued development of combination indoximod immuno-chemotherapy for MPC. Clinical trial information: NCT02077881.",
