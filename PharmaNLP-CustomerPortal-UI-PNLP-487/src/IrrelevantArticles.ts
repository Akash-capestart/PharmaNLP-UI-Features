                "Background: The indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway is a key counter-regulatory mechanism that is exploited by tumors to prevent and evade anti-tumor immunity. Inhibitors of the IDO pathway, such as indoximod, are an increasingly validated class of potential cancer therapeutics. The combination of gemcitabine (G) and nab-paclitaxel (N) is a current SOC for metastatic pancreas cancer (MPC). Pre-clinical models have demonstrated synergy between indoximod and chemotherapy. Methods: Single arm study with indoximod (1200mg BID continuous) plus G / N (1000mg/m2 / 125mg/m2 q week x3 per 4-week cycle). Patients had treatment naïve MPC or 1st line therapy after previous resection and adjuvant therapy. Treatment continued until disease progression or toxicity. Primary endpoint was an improvement in median overall survival (mOS) from a historical 8.5 months for G / N to 12.1 months (hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) by site review RECIST 1.1. An expansion cohort enrolled patients undergoing pre and on-treatment (end Cycle 2) tumor biopsies. Results: A total of 135 patients initiated treatment in Phase 2 including 36 in the biopsy group. 104 were efficacy evaluable (EE) per the pre-specified definition of completing one cycle of therapy with one on-treatment imaging study. The ORR in the EE was 46.2% (48/104) with 1% CR (1/104) and 45.2% PR (47/104). The mOS in the EE was 10.9 months. Combination was generally well tolerated with fatigue, nausea, and anemia being the most commonly observed adverse events. Immunologic data by immunohistochemistry from biopsy samples (n = 11) indicate responders have increased intra-tumoral CD8 density after 2 cycles of therapy compared to non-responders (p = 0.030). Conclusions: EE patients had a mOS of 10.9 months and ORR of 46.2%; responding patients had an increased intra-tumoral CD8 density. The study did not meet the pre-specified primary goal of a 30% reduction in HR. However, the combination demonstrated activity with a promising ORR and immunologic correlation with response. These data support the continued development of combination indoximod immuno-chemotherapy for MPC. Clinical trial information: NCT02077881.",
